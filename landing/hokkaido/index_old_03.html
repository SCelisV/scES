(And a messy one can hurt them.)</h4><p>Pretty simple, right? You&#8217;ve probably heard something similar before. But what the heck does it mean to be “polished” and “professional” on a landing page, anyway? And when it comes to conversions, what&#8217;s the magical x-factor that sets exceptional marketers apart?</p><p>With these questions in mind, we want to show off some fresh landing page examples to inspire your next creation. Go ahead and save their smartest, slickest, and snappiest elements for your swipe file.</p><p>Throughout, we&#8217;ll offer an Unbounce-certified perspective on what makes each page so darn good—and, occasionally, how each could be improved.

Athabasca University</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/athabascauniversity-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/athabascauniversity-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Athabasca University" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.athabascau.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Athabasca University</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>Athabasca University pioneered distance education in Canada in the 1970s. Today, it uses landing pages to boost its online enrolment initiatives, including this example representing its 14 certificate programs. It&#8217;s a smart choice since landing pages allow AU to focus a visitor&#8217;s attention on a particular slice of its many online program offerings.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Education</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Smart copy:</strong> It might be worth testing out a more direct headline, but the copy here matches the school&#8217;s other branding initiatives elsewhere. It&#8217;s also very sharp. The target is clear: people who might further their education but don&#8217;t feel they have time to pursue it. This landing page says otherwise (in words and in its hero image).</li><li><strong>You-oriented copy:</strong> This page is all about me (or, uh, “you”) and not about the “Great and Powerful” Athabasca University. Marketers working in education understand the need to appeal to self-interest better than many of their counterparts in other industries, who can slip into bragging. I’m not sure what part of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs calls for tech bro flexing, but AU does better by appealing to a desire for self-actualization.</li><li><strong>Testimonials:</strong> A little bit of inspiration never hurts. Here, the social proof shows pathways to personal success before people make a significant investment. I&#8217;d test to see if doubling down doesn&#8217;t produce even better results here. Giving each testimonial more visibility and offering a smidge more biography—along with portraits to humanize them—might provide a little boost. (Of course, it might not. But that&#8217;s why we <a href="/conversion-rate-optimization/20-conversion-optimization-tips-for-zooming-past-your-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">test</a>!)</li><li><strong>Z-pattern:</strong> This page is a classic example of a Z-pattern at work. That is—its visual hierarchy takes advantage of the way people typically scan a webpage. In this case, the eye is encouraged to travel from the Athabasca University logo to their tagline (&#8220;Open. Flexible. Everywhere.&#8221;), then diagonally across the heading to the supporting copy, and then finally right to the call to action. (Pow!) Other visual queues also encourage the eye to move down (including, cleverly, the pointed tip of Athabasca crest).</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>2. blow LTD.</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/blowltd-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/blowltd-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Blow LTD" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.blowltd.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blow LTD.</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>If you look past the buzzy &#8220;Uber for beauty&#8221; thing, UK brand blow LTD. solves a genuine problem in a <em>genius</em> way. They offer affordable, professional beauty services that come to you, and—more importantly—you can book an appointment with one of their pros straight from their app. Smartly, landing pages are a big part of their campaign strategy. The example, for instance, promotes in-home eyelash extensions in clever ways.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Beauty</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Crystal-clear value statement:</strong> This landing page doesn&#8217;t mess around with cute copy (e.g., &#8220;Eyes That Amaze&#8221;). Instead, it clearly states the offer and relies on value (and maybe a little bit of novelty) to win over prospective customers. A promise doesn&#8217;t get more unambiguous than &#8220;Eyelash Extensions At Home,&#8221; and that&#8217;s precisely why this headline is so effective.</li><li><strong>Promo code:</strong> Providing a promo code to visitors sweetens the pot, but it’s also doing something more. The call to action (“Book Eyelash Extensions”) redirects to their main website, where they might get distracted or frustrated. The promo provides extra motivation to carry visitors through to complete a booking. Want these savings? Then ya’d best use that code before you forget.</li><li><strong>Social proof:</strong> People are understandably picky about who does their hair and makeup, so providing social proof is a must. The testimonials here have been selected to highlight the personalized nature of the experience too. Since blow LTD. only works if prospects feel they can trust their professionals, providing social proof helps humanize the service and start building relationships.</li><li><strong>Simple steps:</strong> Looking further down the page, we might pause over the &#8220;How It Works&#8221; section. In this post-Uber world, the service offered by blow LTD. is pretty easy to understand, so why bother including a three-step breakdown of it? That&#8217;s just the point, though. This landing page includes these steps to highlight this simplicity. I mean, come on—step three is &#8220;Sit Back &amp; Relax.&#8221; That&#8217;s something I can get behind.</li><li><strong>Subtle app promotion:</strong> Rather than aggressively funneling visitors into an app, the landing page ends with a gentle reminder that you can download the app on your iPhone or Android. (I&#8217;d test a mobile variant of the CTA that goes straight to the app.) Some people will certainly get excited about booking with blow LTD. on the go, but visitors don&#8217;t feel too pressured to whip out their smartphone. Once a visitor has converted, there’ll be plenty of other opportunities to onboard them to the app.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>3. Blue Forest Farms (Agency: Champ/Cannabis Creative)</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blueforestfarms-desktop-full.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/blueforestfarms-inline.jpg" alt="Blue Forest Farms" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://blueforestfarms.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blue Forest Farms</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>We love this incredible design for Blue Forest Farms by <a href="https://www.champinternet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Champ</a> and <a href="https://cannabiscreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannabis Creative</a>. Hemp farmers sometimes have trouble disassociating themselves from cannabis culture. (Tie-dye colors, bong water, and that funky smell coming from your older brother&#8217;s van.) But this stellar B2B landing page takes modernized and, dare we say, adult approach to wholesale hemp oil extracts. From its clean design to persuasive copy, it makes a strong case that this is an industry that demands to be taken seriously.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Hemp</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Expert copy:</strong> Unlike B2C landing pages, this page speaks to a professional crowd. By which I mean, people who know what it means when plant extract contains &#8220;natural terpenes&#8221; and has been &#8220;decarboxylated.&#8221; We might suggest going with a more impactful headline, but wholesalers are likely very aware of the benefits. Cutting to the chase can&#8217;t be a bad thing.</li><li><strong>A &#8216;refined&#8217; approach:</strong> Blue Forest Farms market hemp oil in several states, from crude oil to white label products ready for the market. Beyond just listing these options, this landing page lays out the process through which their hemp is refined, emphasizing the care and craft that go into it.</li><li><strong>Low-intensity lead gen:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen shorter forms, but the lead gen here is relatively straightforward for B2B. (They could test including first and last name in the same field and change some of the language.) It&#8217;s smart to leave an optional field for additional notes since wholesale deals are far more complex than most.</li><li><strong>Simple design:</strong> The kind of conversation that needs to happen in wholesale will stretch beyond a single landing page. Instead of cramming too much information onto the page, Blue Forest Farms keep it short and sweet to encourage contact as soon as possible.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>4. Border Buddy</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/borderbuddy-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/borderbuddy-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Best landing page examples: Border Buddy" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Border Buddy</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>Ever try to cross the border with a 10-pound wheel of Wisconsin cheddar strapped into the passenger seat (and disguised as your wife)? Me neither. But if I did, I&#8217;d want Border Buddy behind me. This landing page works by evoking common anxieties and then offering to solve them without fuss.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Customs</p><p><strong>Why it works&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Presenting the problem:</strong> The headline starts with the pain and insecurity (&#8220;Importing and Exporting Is Hard&#8221;) that any visitor who hits this landing page from a PPC campaign is likely to be feeling. Crucially, though, the promise of a solution appears with equal clarity above the fold: &#8220;We do the hard part for you,&#8221; says Border Buddy. Perfect.</li><li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Bringing your purchases across the border can get very messy, so keeping this landing page clean is essential. There&#8217;s no more information here than what you need to know. No legalese either. You&#8217;ll have a customs broker worrying about all those small details for you.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> At Unbounce, we have a lot to say about <a href="/page-speed-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the impact that page speed can have on your conversion rates</a>. But Border Buddy is already ahead of the curve on this one. On mobile, this landing page takes less than three seconds to hit first meaningful paint. Border Buddy avoids weighing down the page with unnecessary media or scripts, ensuring immediate visitor engagement. (Prepping an SVG version of their logo could shave a few kilobytes off of what&#8217;s already a very lean page.)</li><li><strong>Unexpected vibrancy:</strong> Sometimes marketers associate the push for faster speeds with a need to sacrifice the visual appeal of a landing page. This example from Border Buddy shows it that doesn&#8217;t have to be the case. They&#8217;ve made careful choices in terms of font, layout, and visuals to maximize impact and reinforce branding (without distracting the visitor).</li><li><strong>F-pattern:</strong> Like the Z-pattern, the F-pattern layout mimics the way our eyes move across the screen when we look at content. It reduces <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank">cognitive load</a> and ensures that the key pieces of the message (including the call to action) are located in the places that they&#8217;ll most noticeable.</li></ul><div class="curated-tip"><strong>Slow-loading pages can cost you conversions. </strong> Find out more about optimizing your landing page for speed, like Border Buddy did, with <a href="http://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/features/page-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unbounce’s Speed Boost and AMP support.</a></div><h3>5. Bouquet Bar (Agency: Power Digital Marketing)</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/bouquetbar-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/bouquetbar-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Best landing page examples: Bouquet Bar" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://bouquetbar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bouquet Bar</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p><a href="https://powerdigitalmarketing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Power Digital Marketing</a> created this gorgeous landing page for Bouquet Bar. Though other landing pages target specific holidays, this one says that you don’t need an excuse to treat someone you love (or, y’know, need to impress) to a bouquet. You can do it “Just Because.” Ryan Picardal, the designer who worked on it, describes their goals:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> For a fairly new brand, our team realized that we needed to capitalize on not only driving sales from these landing pages, but also expanding their audience. In order to achieve that, we needed to focus on putting enticing messaging and imagery at the forefront, and ensure that all key benefits Bouquet Bar provides are clearly visible and eye-catching.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Florist/Gifts</p><p><strong>Why it works&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Choose your own adventure:</strong> While maintaining focus is important, sometimes a single call to action doesn&#8217;t quite capture the types of visitors your landing page receives. In these cases, it can be quite effective to provide multiple options. For buyers who want to craft something personal, the first call to action invites you to create your own bouquet. But for those short on time or imagination, &#8220;curated selections&#8221; provide a shortcut to celebrating an important person or occasion.</li><li><strong>Just Because:</strong> 75% of roses sold in the US are purchased by men for Valentine’s Day. And 25% of all adults report buying flowers as gifts on Mother’s Day. It’s likely Bouquet Bar does a significant amount of business around these two days, but the “just because” messaging here invites business during the other 363 days of the year.</li><li><strong>The right color palette:</strong> This point touches on Bouquet Bar’s overall branding, but it’s worth pointing out in the context of the “Just Because” page. Orange, particularly the deep shade they’ve chosen, aligns with the brand’s warm, sophisticated personality. A lot of what gets labeled as <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the psychology of color is fairly dubious</a>—using pink won’t suddenly make your funeral home appear more cheerful—but the accents here definitely support the identity that Bouquet Bar wants to establish.</li><li><strong>Evocative photography:</strong> The gallery helps contextualize the product as an “expression of love, gratitude and friendship” by showcasing people receiving the gift. Images of people can be more effective at evoking emotions than words, so a company like Bouquet Bar is wise to employ them here. The photos also, much more practically, show scale. This can be a real concern when purchasing products sight unseen. It&#8217;s an excellent lesson for anyone practicing ecommerce.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>6. Class Creator</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/classcreator-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/classcreator-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Most Inspiring Landing Page Examples: Class Creator" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.classcreator.io/au/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Class Creator</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>Australia-based Class Creator uses this Unbounce landing page to make inroads in the US market (and, hopefully, help the company secure US partners) when school’s between sessions in their home country. The page showcases many of the product’s features as well as the primary benefits. It targets high-level decision makers who need as much information as possible before they buy.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Education/SaaS</p><p><strong>Why it works..</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Breakin’ the rules:</strong> I know what you&#8217;re going to say. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a landing page. It&#8217;s a homepage. It breaks all the rules. Just look at that navigation bar! Look at all those different links. The <a href="/conversion-centered-design/attention.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Attention Ratio</a> is out of control!&#8221; Grumble, grumble, grumble. But there&#8217;s a lesson here for anyone looking for landing page inspiration: <em>stay flexible</em>. Tim Bowman, Class Creator&#8217;s CEO, told me they&#8217;ve found it more success with this homepage than a traditional conversion-focused landing page. I wanted to include it here as an example of just what you can do.</li><li><strong>Floating navigation bar:</strong> If you must include a navigation bar, it’s best to keep it in view at all times. This also lets Class Creator keep the primary call to action (“Demo School”) at the top of the page so that no scrolling is necessary for their visitors to find it.</li><li><strong>The numbers don’t lie:</strong> Above the fold Class Creator marshals some pretty serious numbers as a form of social proof. They leverage the 10,000+ educators in 13 countries who’re already using their software as a powerful persuasive device.</li><li><strong>Easy access to a product demo:</strong> In the SaaS space, it’s remarkably common to see companies throw up too many barriers between potential customers and demoing their product. (“Submit your firstborn for access to our 5-minute free trial.”) Class Creator knows that it’s essential for prospects to get their hands dirty with a demo or trial version of the software. This ensures that they get to evaluate the product in action, generating qualified leads (with a simple email form) and carrying them further down the funnel.</li><li><strong>Smart use of lightboxes:</strong> This landing page (acting as a homepage) already has a ton to say about Class Creator. Relegating any additional information to lightboxes works to keep it out of the way. It’d certainly be worth their while testing different versions of this page that swap out features for benefits or put the testimonials in a more prevalent place.</li></ul><div class="curated-tip"><strong>Editor’s Note.</strong> If you&#8217;re looking for the creative freedom to make whatever you want, the Unbounce Builder offers that flexibility, whether you want to make a popup or sticky bar, a long-form landing page, or an SEO-optimized page. <a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/how-to-create-a-landing-page/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></div><h3>7. Good Eggs</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/goodeggs-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/goodeggs-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Most Inspiring Landing Page Example: Good Eggs" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Good Eggs</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>The good people at Good Eggs know how to use slick marketing (just look at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.goodeggs.com/sfbay/welcome/step/zip" target="_blank">their rockin’ homepage</a>!). In fact, I think a lot of their landing pages would be a great fit for <a href="/landing-page-examples/best-landing-page-design-examples/">this post about about landing page design</a>. This particular example, which promotes free coconut water, is no exception, but it also offers a masterclass in restraint. It shows how to use a promo to score conversions without becoming overbearing.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Grocery Delivery</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Freebies:</strong> Free seems universally good. But in this case, the promise of free is doing more than appealing to our instinctual love of <em>not paying for stuff</em>. It builds good will, provides a sample of a product that Good Egg carries, and quickly establishes a lifestyle match between the service and the visitor. What do I mean by lifestyle match? Well, if you’re thrilled by the getting free coconut water from Harmless Harvest, you already know Good Eggs will be a great fit for you.</li><li><strong>Added value:</strong> At first, I was taken aback by the headline here because I thought you&#8217;d hit harder with the whole free thing (like, I dunno, &#8220;Free Coconut Water&#8221; could work?). But it’s likely the average Good Eggs customer has more on their mind just getting a deal. Here, the promotion helps show off brand values of wellness, sustainability, and ethical labor practices. So it’s not just free, it’s also a <em>good</em> thing.</li><li><strong>Testimonials:</strong> It can be a little risky to mention your competitors, but Good Eggs gets around this problem by letting a customer do it for them. Sometimes testimonials can get a little samey, repeating the same point in different voices. (That’s not always a bad thing.) Here, though, they’ve been carefully selected to reinforce the three value propositions listed above.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>8. Jet Pet</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/jetpet-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/jetpet-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Most Inspiring Landing Page Example: Jet Pet" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://jetpetresort.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jet Pet</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>For every person living in Vancouver, there must be at least six dogs. Jet Pet understands this city&#8217;s love of pooches, and they&#8217;re big fans of using the Unbounce Builder to advertise their premium dog boarding service and three locations to locals. We’ve included it here because this landing page is an inspiration for anyone targeting a select geographic area.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Pet Care/Boarding</p><p><strong>Why it works&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear value statement:</strong> A simple heading (&#8220;Dog Boarding Vancouver&#8221;) lets the searcher know they&#8217;ve hit the jackpot. For paid campaigns, Jet Pet can also use Unbounce&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="/features/dynamic-text-replacement/" target="_blank">Dynamic Keyword Replacement (DTR)</a> to swap in a search keyword (&#8220;Dog Kennels Vancouver&#8221;) for improved message match. Then, when a prospect clicks on an ad in Google, they’re brought to a page with a headline that matches their expectations.</li><li><strong>Two-stage form:</strong> Typically, using multi-step forms can lead to higher conversion rates than a single long form. Here, a two-stage form reduces psychological friction in two ways. First, it minimizes the perceived effort in signing up for the service. (And even if the second form proves frustrating, someone who&#8217;s already filled out the first form is invested and more likely to continue onward. Sunk cost fallacy FTW.) Second, a <a href="/landing-pages/breadcrumb-technique-increase-landing-page-conversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">two-stage form can delay asking for more &#8220;sensitive&#8221; questions</a> until later.</li><li><strong>Friendliness:</strong> Speaking of the form, I love that the first thing they ask you (and the only required field on the first page) is your dog&#8217;s <em>name</em>. I&#8217;d expect this question if I walked into one of their locations with my pup on a leash, but seeing the same question here made me smile. Jet Pet’s page is full of friendly gestures like this one that make them memorable.</li><li><strong>Trust building:</strong> Trusting somebody else with your dog requires significant peace of mind. So it&#8217;s important that Jet Pet uses copy that builds that trust and leaves their customers feeling secure that they’ve left Fido with ”loving experts” who have his best interest in mind. The reassuring language that Jet Pet uses across the page reinforces this message, including emotionally loaded terms like “care,” “safe,” and “love.”</li><li><strong>Video testimonials:</strong> You don&#8217;t always need a video to have an effective testimonial, but in Jet Pet&#8217;s case, I think this is a smart move. There’s a lot of questionable testimony out there, so showing actual dog owners speaking to the camera helps build further credibility. (I&#8217;d love to see the dogs in these videos too.)</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>9. Mooala (Agency: BuzzShift)</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/mooala-desktop-full.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/mooala_inline.jpg" alt="Great landing page examples: Mooala" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://mooala.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mooala.</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>So it turns out you can milk a banana. Who knew? (Mooala Organic, that&#8217;s who.) Created by <a href="https://www.buzzshift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzShift</a>, the landing page reflects the brand&#8217;s playfulness and sense of fun embodied by their mascot. It&#8217;s also straightforward in a way that inspires a lot of confidence in their product. Cameron Gawley, BuzzShift&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, puts the choices here in a whole-funnel context:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This specific page worked well in the consideration phase of our social ads. Our goal was to add value via a coupon, by capturing an email as a soft conversion and then nurture them forward in the rest of the journey. Most brands have a huge opportunity to grow lower their CPA and increase conversions by focusing more on awareness and consideration.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Beverages/Dairy Alternatives</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>From landing page to offline purchase:</strong> As Gawley points out, the promise of a coupon does double duty as a soft conversion. It builds an email nurture track and encourages an in-store purchase. Since tasting is believing, this is a crucial component of Mooala&#8217;s digital marketing strategy.</li><li><strong>Meeting objections head-on:</strong> Banana haters gonna banana hate. But Mooala should be commended for immediately kicking one possible objection to the curb: &#8220;What is Bananamilk, you ask? It&#8217;s not a sugary-sweet banana smoothie, as you might think.&#8221; By boldly tackling this concern, the copy helps reset expectations and promote the product as &#8220;a light, dairy alternative that you can enjoy guilt-free.&#8221;</li><li><strong>A smartly placed animation:</strong> Videos and animations can be extraordinarily useful, but they can also serve as a distraction if not positioned correctly. I love the inclusion of animation at the bottom of the page, where it&#8217;ll draw the eye toward the CTA instead of distracting from Mooala&#8217;s primary messaging.</li><li><strong>Social queues:</strong> Encouraging visitors to follow the brand&#8217;s social media accounts increases the opportunities to be delightful and stay top of mind.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>10.

(Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>We&#8217;re happy to show off this slick landing page from Pared, an app that matches (or, ahem, pairs) restaurants to pre-qualified kitchen staff. Like the example from Class Creator, Pared doesn&#8217;t need a complicated website to get their message out there. Unbounce&#8217;s drag-and-drop builder gives them the ability to make changes and track conversions. According to Dave Lu, Pared&#8217;s president and co-founder, it&#8217;s been effective, even three years later:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From day one, I was able to quickly pull together a website and landing page for my startup. Because of Unbounce, I can iterate and A/B test changes without needing to involve a designer or developer. This is tremendously liberating and powerful for any marketer.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Restaurants/Staffing</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Speaks to its niche:</strong> Pared isn&#8217;t a service for everyone and they know it. Instead, they have a specific clientele whose needs they match in a big way. This landing page starts with one particular problem these people encounter: &#8220;Never be short-staffed again,&#8221; and goes from there. (They use other web assets for recruiting Pared Pros.)</li><li><strong>Explainer video:</strong> The landing page includes a short explainer that runs viewers through the problem and their solution to it in simple, approachable language. App landing pages, in particular, benefit from these types of videos.</li><li><strong>Big names and logos:</strong> The page includes logos from a wide variety of recognizable eateries and restaurants who use the service. It also includes killer testimonials from chef-owners at San Francisco institutions like Little Gem, Octavia, and Jaridiniere (now sadly gone).</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>11. Twinwoods Adventure (Agency: Bluespark Digital)</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/Indoor-Skydiving.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://mk0zofoqaluvgdskgvsb.kinstacdn.com/photos/indoorskydiving-inline.jpg" alt="Twinwoods Adventure" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://twinwoodsadventure.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twinwoods Adventure</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>You need to see the real page for the full effect. This landing page for Twinwoods Adventure captures the thrill of indoor skydiving through a captivating (and humorous) hero animation and tons of incredible action shots. <a href="https://www.bluespark.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluespark Digital</a> created a page that buzzes with energy and excitement while staying focused on the conversion.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Adventure</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Capturing the experience:</strong> Twinwoods Adventure sell an experience, so social proof is critical in carrying visitors over the golden line from curiosity to conversion. (You can return a lousy product, after all, but bad experiences will be with you for life.) The page hits you with the double whammy of testimonials and review scores from Google, Facebook, and TripAdvisor.</li><li><strong>Hype video:</strong> Some concepts demand video. Indoor skydiving is one of them. The mid-page video here does an incredible job of creating hype for the experience by showing off a range of skill levels. If you thought the wind tunnel was nothing but an oversized hairdryer, boy, you were wrong.</li><li><strong>Keep the number handy:</strong> Like many of the pages we&#8217;ve featured, the design encourages scrolling downwards (clicking the arrow below the CTA carries you to the benefits). But Twinwoods likely do a lot of booking over the phone, so a floating phone number keeps that particular call-to-action visible no matter where people end up on the page.</li><li><strong>Additional info:</strong> Before you get me into a jumpsuit, I&#8217;ve got more questions. (Like, where&#8217;d you guys get the wind tunnel anyway?) That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a relief to find the info I need tucked away on the page. Arguably, these sections could be a little more evident as buttons, but Twinwoods Adventure smartly includes this additional info without stretching the page.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>12. Wavehuggers (Agency: Everett Andrew Marketing)</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/wavehugger-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/wavehugger-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Best Landing Page Examples: Wavehuggers" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="http://wavehuggers.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wavehuggers</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>Created by <a href="https://everettandrew.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everett Andrew Marketing</a>, this brilliant landing page connects safety and fun together through carefully selected visuals and clear, concise messaging. According to Mark Chapman, Founder and President of Everett Andrew, this design was all about standing out:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Our goal in creating the page was to cut through the clutter and crowded market of businesses here in southern California offering surf lessons—both on Google and Facebook. Getting each important conversion component (i.e. social proof, urgency, hero shot, CTA, etc.) into the page, mostly above the fold, was tricky but in the end we found a way to segment these out so each part catches the eye.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Surf Lessons</p><p><strong>Why it inspires&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yelp score:</strong> Even the crummiest of products or services can gather together a few positive testimonials. (“The CEO’s mom thinks we’re cool.”) That&#8217;s why high scores from Yelp, TripAdvisor, Amazon, or Google can complement testimonials, as they do here. It’s much more challenging to maintain strong scores on these sites. (Just remember that visitors can always verify your score for themselves.)</li><li><strong>Timed special offer:</strong> Like many of the examples here, Wavehuggers add urgency to the landing page with a limited time promotion. It may not seem like much—this kind of thing is almost a marketing cliche at this point—but even small tweaks like adding “for a limited time only” to a promo code can affect your conversion rates.</li><li><strong>Safety, comfort, fun:</strong> Prospects are likely seeking out lessons to feel more comfortable on the water. Everything on this landing page focuses on the promise of a positive experience. The copy on this landing page reassures them throughout that surfing is “not as scary as you might think.”</li><li><strong>Real customers:</strong> The photographs here don’t have the polish of some of the others on this list (see Western Rise below), but guess what? They shouldn’t. A stunning stock photograph of a professional surfer hanging ten would be far less effective than these visuals of kids having fun on their boards. From the cursive fonts to the hand-drawn arrows, Wavehuggers’ style reflects the relaxed vibes of surfer culture.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h3>13. Western Rise</h3><div class="blog-photo"><figure><a href="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/western-rises-lp.jpg" class="fancybox iframelpexamples"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38335" src="https://staging-zofoqalu.kinsta.cloud/photos/westernrise-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Best Landing Page Examples: Western Rise" width="750"></a></figure></div><div class="blog-photo-annotation">Image courtesy of <a href="https://westernrise.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Rise</a>. (Click to see the whole thing.)</div><p>Sometimes when prepping a piece like this one, you end up buying the product. I’m very, very close to pulling the trigger on a pair of Western Rise’s AT Slim Rivet Pants. And why not? This sharp landing page quickly establishes the appeal of the product through visuals and copy that stresses the benefits of these &#8220;elevated&#8221; pants. It may be time to give up on my ratty jeans altogether.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> Clothier</p><p><strong>Why it works&#8230;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bold visuals:</strong> These pants may be handmade in Los Angeles, but many of the photos here (including the hero shot) scream Brooklyn. It&#8217;s easy to imagine wearing the AT Slim Rivet Pants as you peddle your fixie through traffic, balancing a latte on your handlebars on the way to a chic rooftop cocktail party.</li><li><strong>Stressing the benefits:</strong> I never thought I’d be writing about the common pain points associated with wearing pants, but here we are. On this landing page, Western Rise addresses them all. Jeans are prone to tearing and tend to overheat. Chinos get dirty and wrinkled. Dress pants are for squares, man. By promising versatility (“pants for all day, every day”) and keeping the benefits up front, Western Rise offers a solution to a problem you didn’t know you had.</li><li><strong>“Tech specs”:</strong> Though there’s some clever copy on display here, Western Rise is extremely straightforward about the features of the AT Slim Rivet Pants in the “Tech specs” section on the page. They provide precise details about materials (“Durable Nylon Canvas” and “Gusseted Crotch”) and design (“Media Pocket” and “Extendable Hem”) in a clear, concise way.</li></ul><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><h2>ABT: Always Be Testing</h2><p>There you have it.
